# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Deva Agent Platform docs.

## Local workflow

1. Create a branch for your change.
2. Keep docs concise and example-first.
3. Use placeholders in public snippets:
   - API key: `deva_your_api_key`
   - Wallet address: `0xYourWalletAddress`
4. Update related docs links if you add pages.
5. Open a PR with a clear summary and screenshots for major structure changes.

## Style guide

- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences).
- Prefer tables for endpoint and pricing lists.
- Include `curl` plus one language-specific example for new APIs.
- Use callouts for operational notes: `> **Tip:** ...`

## Validation checklist

- No internal project references.
- No secrets, real API keys, or private wallet addresses.
- All code blocks are copy-pasteable.
- Cross-links resolve within this repository.
